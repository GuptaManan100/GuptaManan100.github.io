# B³ - Bytes Beats Books

This is the source code for my personal blog website: **[https://guptamanan100.github.io/](https://guptamanan100.github.io/)**

B³ is my corner of the internet where I share thoughts on:
- **Bytes**: Everything tech—distributed systems, high availability, and other code-related explorations
- **Beats**: Personal stories, reflections, and life experiences (with a nod to my love for playing the guitar)
- **Books**: Reviews and recommendations from my ever-growing personal library
