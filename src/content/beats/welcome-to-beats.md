# Welcome to Beats

Welcome to the **Beats** section of B³! This is where I share the rhythms of my life—travel adventures, digital-nomad musings, and occasional musical detours.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Travel & Digital Nomad Life**  
  Stories from the road: life hacks, city guides, local discoveries, and lessons learned while working and wandering.

- **Personal Reflections**  
  Moments of inspiration (and occasional frustration), cultural observations, and snapshots of everyday life far from “home.”

- **Music & Guitar**  
  If inspiration strikes: guitar riffs, song ideas, practice notes, and the occasional amp-on-the-go jam session.

Pull up a chair and let’s explore, one Beat at a time.
