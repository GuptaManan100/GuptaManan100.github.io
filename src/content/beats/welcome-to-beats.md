# Welcome to Beats

Welcome to the **Beats** section of BÂ³! This is where I share my passion for music, primarily focused on guitar playing and the musical discoveries I make while traveling the world.

## What You'll Find Here

## My Musical Journey

As NoCodeNoLife, I believe that music, like code, is a universal language. My guitar travels with me everywhere, and I've found that music creates connections across cultures in ways that words sometimes can't.

## Nomadic Music Challenges

Playing guitar while constantly on the move presents unique challenges:
- Finding quality practice spaces in hostels and co-working spaces
- Maintaining calluses and technique during long travel days
- Discovering local music styles and incorporating them into my playing
- Balancing practice time with work and exploration

## Coming Up

Some content I'm excited to share:
- Portable practice setups for digital nomads

- Acoustic guitar techniques that sound great without amplification
