# Welcome to Books

Welcome to the **Books** section of B³! This is where I share my reading journey—reviews, recommendations, and reflections from my ever-growing library.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Book Reviews**  
  Honest takes on recent reads: what worked, what didn’t, and who might enjoy them.

- **Recommendations & Reading Lists**  
  Curated lists spanning all genres—distributed systems, dark undertones, whimsical fiction, and more. If it’s got a spine, I’m likely to read it.

- **Book Club Corner**  
  Insights and highlights from discussions at **Books and Brew**: monthly picks, favorite discussion points, and reader feedback.

- **Reading Notes & Insights**  
  Key takeaways, favorite passages, and discussion prompts to spark conversation.

Pull up a chair and let’s turn the page, one book at a time.
