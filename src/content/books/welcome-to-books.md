# Welcome to Books

Welcome to the **Books** section of BÂ³! This is where I share my love for reading, from technical books that enhance my coding skills to fiction that transports me to different worlds.

## What You'll Find Here

## Reading as a Nomad

Reading while traveling presents both opportunities and challenges:
- **Opportunities**: Discovering local authors, finding unique bookshops, and having quiet time during long travel days
- **Challenges**: Weight limits for physical books, finding good reading spots, and building a consistent routine

## My Reading Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Diverse perspectives**: Reading authors from different backgrounds and cultures
- **Balanced diet**: Mixing technical books with fiction and non-fiction
- **Active reading**: Taking notes and reflecting on key insights
- **Community**: Sharing recommendations and discussing ideas
