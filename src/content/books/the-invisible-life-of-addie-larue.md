## 💭 Quick Summary & Thoughts

The book started with a lot of promise, because the premise of it was extra-ordinary. Once the build-up was done, there were endless possibilities the book could take. Having read *A Darker Shade of Magic* by the same author, I was quite excited, because she had delivered a really plot-heavy story then, and I thought something similar was in store in this case.

Unfortunately, as the book went on, I got more and more disillusioned, that instead of using the wonderful world setup and premise, she chose to squander it all away in repetitive scenes and a (quite, frankly) predictable and idiotic love story.

There are a few redeeming qualities for the book. There are no obvious mistakes in the plot, the writing style is fine, and there are some good quotes in the book. The book ends at a note that hints at a sequel, and again can really pack a punch.

I feel the book was a little slow, and should have actually been much smaller, and should have had the content that she's planning to add in the sequel, cause quite frankly the plot is weak. I will still always remember the book for what it *could have been* instead of what it is.

Okay where do I start!? Let's start by talking about how Addie couldn't figure out in 300 years that she can make someone else write on her behalf! What!? Really!? That isn't so hard to figure out. When the scene for her trying to write and it getting erased came up, my first thought was what if you asked someone else to write for her, then just because the act of writing is done by someone else, their mark can't be erased, so it should stick. We also have scenes where Addie makes other people write to order in a restaurant, so the concept wasn't clearly alien to her. She could have written so much, unveiled so many secrets.

Her character in general is so bland and monotonous. In 300 years of life, she hasn't accomplished anything! Apart from learning a few languages, and re-reading books, she's pretty much squandered the time away. There are references to her playing part of a spy, but there were no details provided on that front.

300 years is such a long life, that I figured it itself opens up so many avenues of cool stories set in different historic settings, but we got none of them. The French Revolution, World War I and II, and so many other world events, she lived through them all, and was completely inconsequential to each and everyone one of them.

She had already figured out that she can plant ideas in other people's heads, and I would have loved to see it being of more use than just being a mule. All she's accomplished in her 300 years of life, is drinking coffee, while feeling sorry for herself.

Other characters in the book are not much better. Luke is the classic devil in a suit, and who would have thought, he'd fall in love with Addie 🤮. All the interactions between him and Addie are so repetitive. Just one or two would have been enough, I really didn't like reading so many of them. They just never seemed to finish!

Introduction of Henry was the start of the decline of the novel. That's when the realization that I will not find anything worth reading in the book started finally setting in. Who would have thought, that the character looking exactly like what Addie imagined Luke to be, would serve as the love interest. Everything post a certain point was predictable. The sacrifice of Addie for Henry, like we didn't see that coming like a bazillion pages ago.

Overall, the book significantly lacks plot points. The premise and the buildup was the only good part about the book. It desperately needs more content. The book should have gotten rid of a lot of the parts that added no value, and instead progressed the story forward instead of leaving at a point that hints at a sequel.
