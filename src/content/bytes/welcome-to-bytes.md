# Welcome to Bytes

Welcome to the **Bytes** section of B³! This is where I dive deep into the technical aspects of software engineering, with a particular focus on:

## What You'll Find Here

- **Distributed Systems**: Exploring the challenges and solutions in building scalable, resilient systems
- **Parsers & Compilers**: Deep dives into language processing and AST manipulation
- **System Design**: Real-world architectural decisions and trade-offs
- **Performance Engineering**: Optimization techniques and profiling insights
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects and building tools

## My Perspective

As a digital nomad working with distributed teams, I bring a unique perspective on:
- Remote collaboration in technical projects
- Building systems that work across different time zones and networks
- Tools and practices that enable location-independent development

## Coming Up

Some topics I'm excited to explore:
- Building a distributed task queue from scratch
- Parser combinators in Rust
- Consensus algorithms in practice
- Debugging distributed systems in production

Stay tuned for deep technical content, practical insights, and the occasional war story from the trenches of software engineering!
