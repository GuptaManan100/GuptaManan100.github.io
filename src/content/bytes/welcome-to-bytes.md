# Welcome to Bytes

Welcome to the **Bytes** section of B³! This is where I dive deep into the technical aspects of software engineering, with a particular focus on:

## What You'll Find Here

- **Distributed Systems**: Challenges and solutions for building scalable, resilient architectures
- **High Availability**: Strategies for ensuring systems remain operational under failure and scale demands
- **Parsers & Compilers**: Language processing and AST manipulation.
- **System Design**: Real-world architectural decisions, trade-offs, and best practices
- **Performance Engineering**: Profiling, optimization techniques, and benchmarking insights
- **Open Source**: Contributing to projects, tooling, and community-driven development

Dive in for deep technical content, practical insights, and the occasional war story from the trenches of software engineering. Let’s tackle code and scale—one byte at a time.
